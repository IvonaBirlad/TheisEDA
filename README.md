# EDA for MSc Thesis SemEval2021

This repository contains the Explortory Data Analysis part within the context of my thesis project. The aim of this thesis is to develop a system for table statement verification and evidence finding. The use case for this project is to promote proper interpretation of scientific articles by helping users understand the information presented in tables.

## Tasks

Two tasks are defined by the SemEval Task organizers: 

### Table Statement Support

The first subtask of this project is to determine whether a table supports a given statement. This will involve developing a method to analyze the table data and determine whether the statement is supported by the information presented.

### Relevant Cell Selection

The second subtask of this project is to identify the cells in the table that provide evidence for the statement. This will involve developing a method to analyze the table data and determine which cells contain the information needed to support the statement.
